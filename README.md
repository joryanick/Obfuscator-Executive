## Installation

To use Obfuscator Executive, download the installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/joryanick/Obfuscator-Executive/releases/latest).

**Important Note:**
This is a binary-only release.

## Usage

1. **Launch Obfuscator Executive:** After installation, simply run the executable from the desktop shortcut or the start menu program directory.
2. **Import Your Application:** Press the 'Open File' button or use the file menu to import your executable, DLL, .OCX, or .BIN file. Your file is examined and a list of vulnerable symbols is presented.
3. **Symbol Selection:** Mark each symbol you want to conceal with a red â˜… star. During analysis, some invalid symbols may be identified. To prevent crashes in your obfuscated binary, only mark with a red star the symbols you have named yourself. Examples to avoid: 'a2dc', 'Q8IH'.
4. **Obfuscate:** Initiate the obfuscation process and let Obfuscator Executive do its job. Your file is transformed into a new, secure binary with a '-ob' extension.
5. **After Obfuscation:**  Your new binary is loaded and analyzed for review. If your binary is an application, it can be launched for testing by clicking the green filename. To ensure success, it is essential to thoroughly test the obfuscated binaries created by this tool.
